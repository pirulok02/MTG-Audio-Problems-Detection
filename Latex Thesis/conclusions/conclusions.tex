\chapter{Conclusions}

After the grid search results, the project has to conclude with a result that has been not satisfactory and maybe due to the time set to deliver the thesis hasn't been explored as in-depth as it should have been. After seeing the accuracies of all the algorithms being so low and, after a manual re-inspection of the audios that were detected or not as problematic, I can almost certainly state that with a most accurate ground truth (the ground truth was a manual annotation of the author), the results would be more convincing. The algorithms themselves perform fairly well when evaluated in some cherry picked audio files, however, when executed in the whole dataset there were some issues that should be revised in a later revision of the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The whole dataset being mono audio files mean that the phase issues have not been able to be evaluated
    \item Some algorithms gave unsatifying results such as hum and silence, a further exploration of the algorithms should be done to modify them as the use case for the algorithms and the use case for the project differ considerably
    \item The annotation for the dataset used in the grid search in the results section did not prove to be a reliable ground truth upon further investigation.
\end{itemize}
